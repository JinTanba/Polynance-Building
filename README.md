# Polynance Contract ðŸ“¦

## ðŸš€ Overview

Prediction markets havenâ€™t tapped into Ethereumâ€™s full composability nor captured the vast liquidity flowing through DeFi. Challenges like CLOB design, ERC-1155 position tokens, volatility management, and price oracles remainâ€”but all are solvable. Bridging prediction markets with other DeFi protocols unlocks immense potential.

As an aggregation layer, **Polynance** recognizes this opportunity and is building several modules on Polymarket. Serving as a gateway, Polynance will funnel more capital and betting activity into Polymarket.
