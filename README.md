# Polynance Contract 📦

## 🚀 Overview

Prediction markets haven’t tapped into Ethereum’s full composability nor captured the vast liquidity flowing through DeFi. Challenges like CLOB design, ERC-1155 position tokens, volatility management, and price oracles remain—but all are solvable. Bridging prediction markets with other DeFi protocols unlocks immense potential.

As an aggregation layer, **Polynance** recognizes this opportunity and is building several modules on Polymarket. Serving as a gateway, Polynance will funnel more capital and betting activity into Polymarket.
